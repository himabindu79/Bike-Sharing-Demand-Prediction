# ðŸš² Bike Demand Prediction - Seoul Bike Sharing

This project focuses on building a predictive analytics solution to forecast hourly demand for the *Seoul Bike Sharing* system. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and machine learning models, we identify patterns in bike usage and optimize demand forecasting.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

* Cleaned and preprocessed complex *temporal and meteorological datasets*
* Handled *outliers, missing values, and **multicollinearity*
* Conducted in-depth *exploratory data analysis (EDA)*
* Engineered features from date-time and weather variables
* Built and compared multiple regression models:

  * *Linear Regression*
  * *Decision Tree Regressor*
  * *Random Forest Regressor*
  * *XGBoost Regressor*
* Evaluated models using:

  * *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*
  * *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*
  * *RÂ² Score*
* Selected *XGBoost* as the best model with *RÂ² = 0.935*, explaining 94% of demand variance

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

* *Source*: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset (available on Kaggle/UCI)
* *Features*: Date, Hour, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Rainfall, Snowfall, Seasons, Holidays, and Bike Count

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The XGBoost model outperformed all others, achieving:

* *RÂ² Score*: 0.935
* *RMSE*: Low
* *Interpretability*: Provided clear feature importance to inform operational decisions

## âœ… Conclusion

The project demonstrates how predictive modeling can help *optimize bike allocation* and improve *resource planning* in urban transportation systems.
